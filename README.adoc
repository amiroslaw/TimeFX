== TimeFX
GUI application for presenting taskwarrior data on charts. I was disappointed with the reporting capacity in https://timewarrior.net/[Timewarrior] or https://taskwarrior.org[Taskwarrior]. I've tried a few plugins for Timewarrior but I thought that a GUI application would be way better and more appealing for the eyes.

TimeFX is written in Java with JavaFX, but it’s quite small and fast if you choose the native-image version. Java 17 is required for the jar package.

=== Usage
The application requires only Timewarrior for collecting data, but if you want to integrate it with Taskwarrior, you can add a hook for that. In the  https://timewarrior.net/docs/taskwarrior/[official documentation] is the instruction on how to install hooks. 

==== Custom hook 
If you use my hook, TimeFX can support tags (projects and contexts) from Taskwarrior.
The problem with the original script is that it doesn't recognize Taskwarrior tags. I forked it (it's in `task/hooks` directory) and modified it like this: 

.Hook with tags for taskwarrior
[source,python]
----
def extract_tags_from(json_obj):
    # Extract attributes for use as tags.
    tags = [json_obj['description']]
    contexts = ['car', 'cod', 'fin', 'per']

    if 'tags' in json_obj:
        for tag in json_obj['tags']:
            if tag in contexts:
                tags.append('+' + tag)
        # tags.extend(json_obj['tags'])
    if 'project' in json_obj:
        tags.append('%' + json_obj['project'])

	return tags
----

What can you see, from now on in Timewarrior each project will have a prefix `%` and context will have `+` but I limited them to a few ones (`contexts` array).

=== Future features and remarks

* if task has multiple tags without a prefix, TimeFX will count only the first one in the report
* date ranges do not include the current day

* [ ] configuration file to change prefixes for tags
* [ ] report results may differ from Timewarrior because TimeFX does not split tasks at midnight
