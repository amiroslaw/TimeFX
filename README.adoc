== TimeFX
GUI application for presenting Timewarrior data on charts. I was disappointed with the reporting capacity in https://timewarrior.net/[Timewarrior] or https://taskwarrior.org[Taskwarrior]. I've tried a few plugins for Timewarrior, but I thought that a GUI application would be way better and more appealing for the eyes.

=== Usage
The application requires only Timewarrior for collecting data, but if you want to integrate it with Taskwarrior, you can add a hook for that. In the https://timewarrior.net/docs/taskwarrior/[official documentation] is the instruction on how to install hooks. 

Data for graphs are taken from JSON exported by Timewarrior. 

[source,bash]
----
timew export :all
----

==== Custom hook 
If you use my hook, TimeFX can support tags (projects and contexts) from Taskwarrior.
The problem with the original script is that it doesn't recognize Taskwarrior tags. I forked it (it's in `task/hooks` directory) and modified it this way: 

.Hook with tags for taskwarrior
[source,python]
----
def extract_tags_from(json_obj):
    # Extract attributes for use as tags.
    tags = [json_obj['description']]
    contexts = ['car', 'cod', 'fin', 'per']

    if 'tags' in json_obj:
        for tag in json_obj['tags']:
            if tag in contexts:
                tags.append('+' + tag)
        # tags.extend(json_obj['tags'])
    if 'project' in json_obj:
        tags.append('%' + json_obj['project'])

	return tags
----

What can you see, from now on in Timewarrior each project will have a prefix `%` and context will have `+` but I limited them to a few ones (`contexts` array).

==== Running application
There are two versions of the application:

**Native Image** 
The file "timefx" is a Java Native Image, bundled for Linux - it doesn't require Java. May require additional system dependencies. In order to run the application just run `./timefx` in the terminal.

**jar** 
The jar file "TimeFX.jar" needs Java 17 with the JavaFX runtime. 
To accomplish this, install Java 17, download JavaFX library and run belowe command. Detailed quide is on the https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-javafx[official website].

[source,bash]
----
java --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls  -jar "path/to/TimeFX.jar"
----

There is an option to have Jave with prebuild JavaFX form https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/[Liberica], so execution will be simpler:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar "path/to/TimeFX.jar"
----

=== Future features and remarks

* if task has multiple tags without a prefix, TimeFX will count only the first one in the report
* date ranges do not include the current day

* [ ] configuration file to change prefixes for tags
* [ ] report results may differ from Timewarrior because TimeFX does not split tasks at midnight
